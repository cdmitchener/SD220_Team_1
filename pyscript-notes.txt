NOTES
---------------------------------
+ Be sure to run write-to-html.py if any changes are made in it, that way game.html
  reflects those updates.


+ If you import a local Python script from file by using the src parameter of the
  py-script tag, follow the syntax below:
        <py-script src=".path/to/script.py"></py-script>


+ If utilizing local files, you will receive errors. The solution to this is to use
  a webserver to serve those files. In the command prompt type the following:
        python -m http.server
            
            OR

        python -m http.server (specify port number)
  Navigate to whichever port it is using and add /game.html (or whatever file name you
  assigned in the write-to-html.py file)


+ From "PyScript - Getting Application Data"
  https://www.jhanley.com/blog/pyscript-getting-application-data/

  "PyScript applications cannot request the user to type characters in response to
  Python input type of functions. PyScript applications must use HTML DOM elements
  to create a GUI that data is entered into. Then the application can read the data
  from those elements." See this link:
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/User_input_methods#tutorials


+ "Pyscript: JavaScript Event Callbacks"
  https://www.jhanley.com/blog/pyscript-javascript-callbacks/
  (good resource on create_proxy())


+ "Intro to PyScript: Run Python in the browser"
  https://blog.logrocket.com/pyscript-run-python-browser/#attaching-events-elements
  (overall really good tutorial, plus maybe a way to save and load data?)

+ create_proxy() -- IMPORTANT TO KNOW!!!
  CAN ONLY BE USED ONCE! Not in the sense that it can be used once and then it no
  longer functions if you try to use it again, but that it cannot be assigned to
  the same JavaScript element and used to call a different function. Once an element
  is used with create_proxy(), it will be used to call the same function, even if
  you code it to call a different one.
    e.g.: name_proxy = create_proxy(player_name)
          confirm_button = document.getElementById("confirm-btn")
          confirm_button.addEventListener("click", name_proxy)

          The confirm button will always callback the player_name() function.

          So, even if you code this later:

          x_proxy = create_proxy(some_function)
          confirm_button = document.getElementById("confirm-btn")
          confirm_button.addEventListener("click", x_proxy)

          It will still callback to the player_name() function and not the
          some_function() function!!!!
