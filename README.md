Our client is a small indie game studio.

The system will be a text-based adventure game, much like the classic game Zork. The player can choose where to go and what to do using text. Usually the player will make those decisions based on the description given to them. For example, they enter a room where there is only one door, two windows, a bed, a nightstand, a candle holder with a lit candle in it, a chest, and a dresser. They might choose to think that it's just an ordinary room and turn back around to leave, or they might choose to investigate the chest. The point of the game is to be a mini getaway from reality. The endgame might be rediscovering a lost artifact of humanity's past, as an adventurer in the year 2776!

Since this is still in early development, error checking and invalid input have not beeen implemented yet. Please be sure to enter something
into the input field when prompted. If you run into problems past the point in the game where it asks which direction you'd like to go, the most
likely culprit is a typo. Just refresh your page and try again.

Anything past the prompt asking which direction you'd like to go will not operate properly at this point in time.
