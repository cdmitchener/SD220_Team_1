NOTE:

Since this is still in early development, error checking and invalid input have not beeen implemented yet. Please be sure to enter something
into the input field when prompted. If you run into problems past the point in the game where it asks which direction you'd like to go, the most
likely culprit is a typo. Just refresh your page and try again.

Anything past the prompt asking which direction you'd like to go will not operate properly at this point in time.

1. First, make sure that the indentation in game.html matches the indentation in write-to-html.py.
   The code that's between py-script tags won't work if the indentation is off.

2. Please do not use Live Server because the game will not function the way it should.

    UPDATE: After figuring out how to get create_proxy() to work, there is no need to do this.
            Using Live Server works!

            If you decide to use Live Server, ignore the rest of the steps; however, when
            Live Server starts up, be sure to add /game.html at the end of the url.

3. In the terminal type the following:

        python -m http.server

    This will create a webserver on default port 8000. 
    If you want the port to be something else, type this then:

        python -m http.server 3000

    or whatever port number you want.

4. Navigate to localhost:8000/game.html
  (or whatever port number you chose instead of 8000)
